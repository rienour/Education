# CS250 Module 8 Journal

The purpose of this journal is to address essential questions in the field of computer science. These questions aim to provide open-ended responses to prompt thinking about the real-world application of principles in the field.

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs are interpreted during the requirements gathering process and feedback provided during the development of a project, when the project employs AGILE principles. The requirements may be gathered through interviews with user(s), questionnaires, or observation. Each of these methods helps a project manager, software developers, tester, or system analyst understand what the goal is for the user and their desired outcome.

User stories can help with this process by providing a clear indication of the goals from the user perspective, with no consideration for the technical level detail. These stories can create a bare bones outline of what pieces of a project need to be worked on or pieces of several projects that need to be addressed for the manifestation of the user vision.

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

In general, I approach program development by starting at the highest level, which I commonly consider my interpretation of the initial user description. Once I've got the general idea, I will focus on breaking down that project into the basic components of what needs to be accomplished, often through multiple iterations to find the solution that matches the problem domain and future consideration based on the user vision. As I develop a program, I create small pieces and tests as I go to prevent missing requirements or introducing regressions with the addition of features.

From my daily professional work, I fully intend to advocate for daily stand-ups and user stories in the future. For solo projects, the user stories can provide an interesting perspective to decouple the technical requirements set forth, for example on a rubric, from the implementation details. One process I'd like to further refine is the retrospective process to better review the things I've done, even before getting a grade back or user feedback.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development revolves around clear communication, openness to new ideas, and seeking constructive criticism. Communication is an essential part of professional software development, whether it be with a co-worker or member of the C-suite of the company you work for. Being able to clearly communicate will enable a good software developer to write better code. Openness to new ideas is crucial for the continuous learning and improvement of a software developer. Technology shifts rapidly and sometimes other developer can envision the solution to a problem in a different way than you can. Even if that solution isn't necessarily better for the specific use case, it adds another tool to the developer tool kit to accomplish goals. Finally, constructive criticism is a valuable tool that software developers should welcome. The challenge of ideas can lead to innovation when done properly.
