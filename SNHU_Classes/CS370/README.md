# CS370 Module 8 Journal

## What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project I was provided the code that handled the game logic and environment setup.The code I created was the code that handled processing each epoch for the intelligent agent, specifically the section with the label `Q-Training Algorithm Code Block` in the Jupyter notebook.

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

At a high-level computer scientists design, analyze, and implement algorithms within a given problem domain to solve problems, specifically through computers. We develop software and applications to meet the needs of a user in a given problem domain, with the goal of making the intended actions of the user easier to accomplish or completely automated. This process can involve many different fields from hardware design in embedded systems, creating efficient data analysis algorithms, working with artificial intelligence/machine learning, and working on increased security in the field of cybersecurity.

The field of computer science matters because it drives technological innovation in almost every field that is worked in. It pushes the boundaries of technology to continue improving the processes that are worked in the real world. This improvement can continue to lead to a better understanding of the world around us. Aside from innovation of new technology, it also improves the efficiency at which things can be done.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist requires an approach from both a technical and non-technical angle. The technical side of this would be understanding the constraints of the technologies to utilize, trade offs based on the requirements of the project, and breaking down the problem into easier to solve problems. Requirements are often gathered from non-technical users, so it's important to be able to translate the English requirements of a user to the technical domain a problem will be solved in. After the requirements have been gathered and analyzed, the process of breaking the problem down into smaller, isolated sub problems can create the holistic view of the system in a maintainable way. The solution would then need to be designed that meets the design with consideration for the appropriate data structures, algorithms, and technologies. Additional considerations for the solution would require consideration for the physical resources and how it may need to grow, if at all. As the solution is designed, it would need to be tested to verify the correctness and stability set forth by the requirements. Throughout the whole process it's important to consider who will utilize the system, how failures can impact them, and how will it be secure.

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization align to those outlined by the IEEE Code of Ethics. For the end user this would include protecting their data, making sure the solution is accessible, provide accurate information, prioritize their safety, and be transparent. For the organization it would be maintaining integrity about the capabilities, limitations, and risks of the system, protecting the proprietary information of the organization within reason of the IEEE Code of Ethics, build a system that is secure, uphold high standards of code, and finally (and arguably most important) take accountability for your code and solutions.
