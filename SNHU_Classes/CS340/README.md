# CS340 Module 8 Journal

The purpose of this journal is to reflect on the work done with client/server development.

## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? What are the advantages of working this way? How could the CRUD module be used in the future?

I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by applying OOP principles, utilizing built-in language features, and leveraging tools that improve the development process. The benefit to working this way is providing a methodical and systematic way to work on a code base. Specifically for the CRUD module this enables the same connection to be used for other types of programs that may connect to this database.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? How did this differ from previous courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet client needs?


My approach to solving a problem focuses on getting the high-level requirements from the stakeholders. These requirements will set the initial path to understand the core purpose of the application to develop. This will then lead to asking more questions to get a more detailed breakdown of what the specific pieces of the application are meant to accomplish. Continual feedback and communication with stakeholders can lead to effectively designing a system, which can be utilized and tested for further development. An additional step that would be crucial both during the design and implementation phases would be dedicating resources to design good tests for the system. Tests for functionality and security are essential, arguably more so for fast moving projects as in an Agile development environment. With professional experience outside this course, there was not a meaningful difference to my approach solving problems as compared to previous courses. When creating databases for clients in the future I would focus on providing a meaningful to their data in a way that is not only easy to consume, but expand and utilize for data analysis purposes.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

At a high-level computer scientists design, analyze, and implement algorithms within a given problem domain to solve problems, specifically through technology. We develop software and applications to meet the needs of a user in a given problem domain, with the goal of making the intended actions of the user easier to accomplish or completely automated. Additionally considering how the program will evolve over time to make decisions in the best interest of the code base. This process can involve many different fields from hardware design in embedded systems, creating efficient data analysis algorithms, working with artificial intelligence/machine learning, and working on increased security in the field of cybersecurity.

This type of project would help a compeny do their work better by providing meaningful data for quick sifting to make company decisions without spending an excessive amount of time doing so.
