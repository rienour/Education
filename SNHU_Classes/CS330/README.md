# CS330 Module 8 Journal

This journal is intended to provide student reflection on the things learned while working with the computer graphic and visualization technologies through the course.

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

Working with a different style of programming with the global context of OpenGL has provided ways to think differently than other educational assignments with a higher focus on memory efficiency due to the real time nature of the graphics rendering. This project has introduced another development methodology for me to be aware of and utilize dependent on the proejct I work on.

## What design process did you follow for your project work?

For the work on this 3D scene project I leveraged modularizing the complex objects in my scene to encapsulate the logic required for rendering a single object. This encapsulation made it easy to make tweaks to a single object and know where to make the updates during the placement/building process.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Exercising good encapsulation and abstractions can improve work in other areas of development following Object Oriented Principles. This could be utilized on a different type of technology, such as a Web API under the Model View Controller design pattern.

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

An interesting strategy I utilized was utilizing trigonometry to help with some of the projections to statically position the elements based on their rotations. I was also drawing out some of the shapes I wanted to make and marking their origins to help give me a more concrete idea, prior to writing code, for positioning the elements in the scene.

## How did iteration factor into your development?

The iteration factored played a monumental role in this project, most notably due to needing to build the project after each change to get a visual representation. Building the shapes was the start of the incremental process where I would build out small sections at a time, with a single mesh, to get them into the position I wanted. I would then build and position the next portion of an object. As I moved the meshes around I continually rendered the scene to catch any inaccuracies. The lighting was another step that required constant tweaking to try to get colors representative of the scene I utilized for reference. Again, building between each tweak allowed me to see how my changes impacted the scene.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

My approach to developing code has increased the reliance on working on unknown technologies with a version control system. I utilized Git to make sure once I got to a point that the changes were representative of what I wanted for the project that I'd be able to easily get back to them. Especially while working with the lighting I utilized commits with messages indicating why I was making a commit for that particular change.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

In my future educational pathway I can utilize the knowledge I gained with the prefabricated OpenGL abstractions to further my own knowledge. It's created a pathway to learn more about the inner workings of the system. It also gave me opportunities to understand how the mathematical transformations relate from the math based context to the computer science context and finally to the visual context.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Being capable of working on different technologies continually refines the developer ability to solve various kinds of problems. Understanding the complex transformations and mathematics in the context of computer graphics and visualization can actually help lead to the AI/ML learning field when working with things like reinforcement learning algorithms.
