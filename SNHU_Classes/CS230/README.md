# CS230: Operating Platforms

The purpose of this module is to reflect on the student understanding of data structures and algorithms as they relate to solving real world problems with consideration for both business and practical requirements.

1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

    The Gaming Room was a client that indicated they would like to expand the functionality of their Draw It or Lose It android application to other platforms. They would like to utilize a web-based version of the game and were looking to get the infrastructure set-up to create the application.

1. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

    The recommendation section was a part I felt I did well due to the amount of research conducted and utilizing prior knowledge of cloud-based systems to provide a solution that meets the client’s needs with consideration for the future of the application.

1. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

    When working through a design document, prior to making code, I found it helpful to be able to refer to the business logic side of the application to understand the importance of different aspects. It helped guide the decisions made during the design process that would best address the client requirements and consider for future expansion/maintenance of the project.

1. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

    If I were to revisit a particular part of this design document, I would focus on the executive summary section. From a stakeholder perspective, this section is arguably the most important part of the document. A vague or underdeveloped executive summary leads to confusion and could result in loss of the client if it is not properly written. It's important as a software developer to be able to convey the intention and requirements of a system in a way that non-technical users can understand what the plan is and make an informed decision. I'd improve this section by specifically explaining the prospective solution and my understanding of the business domain for the requirements to better link to the vision of the client.

1. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

    I interpreted the user's needs by thoroughly reviewing the baseline requirements they outlined during the initial phases of the project, and making sure the high-level requirements set were accounted for in the design of their application. It is important to consider the user, and client needs when designing an application, because the application is specifically designed for their use. As a software developer it's important to understand how the system will be utilized from the perspective of the client rather than the system, otherwise the requirements may not align at all with the intention of the stakeholders.

1. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

    I approached designing the software by performing research based on the requirements set by the client. This research included understanding the different design patterns that could be utilized by the application, the availability of resources in the problem domain, and consideration for future proofing the project. In a future design project, I would utilize the same principles, though I would likely include other high-level diagrams of the application that would expedite the development process and provide a clear connection between the business requirements and project.
