# CS320 Module 8 Journal

The purpose of this journal is to address questions relating to software quality, design, and correctness. These questions aim to provide open-ended responses to prompt thinking about the real-world application of principles in the field.

## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure software projects that I work on is functional and secure through various forms of testing. Unit tests can provide an atomic, and early, way to review the application functionality. As the application continue to build, the introduction of integration tests can further prove the functionality of the system as well as prevent regressions. As the system continues to progress end-to-end testing could be introduced to test the application from a more holistic picture from the functionality. Static testing tools, such as dependency checkers like Maven would be one way to ensure code is secure on top of writing the appropriate tests for the code base.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Creating a clear understanding of the goal for the users to create a tool that can solve their problems through guided questions starts my interpretation process. Previously I would focus more on getting the designs in place for the system for development, however this course has made me realize that incorporating a testing plan during the inception of the project is a highly effective way to incorporate the user needs into the program, even if the program can not accomplish those needs when they are first created for the user.

## How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software focuses on getting the high-level requirements from the users and/or stakeholders. These will set the initial requirements to begin understanding the core purpose of the application to develop. This will then lead to asking more questions to get a more detailed breakdown of what the specific pieces of the application are meant to accomplish. Continual feedback and communication with stakeholders can lead to effectively designing a system, which can be utilized and tested for further development. An additional step that would be crucial both during the design and implementation phases would be dedicating resources to design good tests for the system. Tests for functionality and security are essential, arguably more so for fast moving projects as in an Agile development environment.
